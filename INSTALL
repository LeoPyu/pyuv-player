1. Binary install
=================

The preferred way to for installing PYUV is to download the proper binary for your OS/architecture combination:

* Windows 32 bit self-installer (Windows XP/Vista/7/8/10)
* Ubuntu 64 bit package (>= Ubuntu 15.10)

The binaries can be downloaded from

2. Install from source code
===========================

If your architecture/OS is not currently supported, PYUV can be compiled from the sources. 
The only basic requirements are wxWidgets 3.0 and a modern C++ compiler.


2.1 GNU/Linux
-------------

The configure script can (almost) cover all common distributions requirements, thus the commands are as simple as

$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install


2.2 Windows
-----------

Use the extras/MSVC workspace, containing a Visual Studio 2008 (VC9) solution and projects. For compilation, it is expected that the environment variable %WXWIN30% is set, pointing to the main install folder of wxWidgets 3.0.
