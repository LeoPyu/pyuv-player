1. Binary install
=================

The preferred way to for installing PYUV is to download the proper binary for your OS/architecture combination:

* Windows 32 bit self-installer (>= Windows XP)
* Ubuntu 64 bit package (>= Ubuntu 15.10)
* Apple Mac OS X 64 bit archive (>= Mountain Lion)

The binaries can be downloaded from

* http://dsplab.diei.unipg.it/software/pyuv_raw_video_sequence_player
* https://github.com/gbaruffa/pyuv-player


2. Install from source code
===========================

If your architecture/OS is not currently supported, PYUV can be compiled from the sources. 
The only basic requirements are wxWidgets 3.0 (www.wxwidgets.org) and a modern C++ compiler.


2.1 GNU Autotools
-----------------

Autotools can be used to generate a configuration script.
The configure script can (almost) cover all common distributions requirements, thus the commands are as simple as

$ aclocal
$ autoconf
$ autoheader
$ automake --add-missing
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install


2.2 Windows
-----------

Use the extras/MSVC workspace, it contains a Visual Studio 2008 (VC9) solution and projects. For compilation, it is expected that the environment variable %WXWIN30% is set, pointing to the main install folder of wxWidgets 3.0.


2.3 Extras
----------

There is a Ubuntu packaging script in extras/DEB.
For Windows, there is an InnoSetup script in extras/MSVC.
For Mac OS X, the packaging script is in extras/APPLE.
For FreeBSD, a package can be generated using the script in extras/FREEBSD.
The folder extras/ART contains the sources of the various icons that are generated.
The folder extras/freedesktop contains files required for correct desktop integration in many linux distributions.
